    <string name="about_msg">&lt;b>VIVACHICLAYO&lt;/b> was initially started at the 
        &lt;b>Private University of Juan MejÃ­a Baca (UMB)&lt;/b>  by interns from 
        Brigham Young University, who wanted to give tourists of Chiclayo, 
        Peru easier access to information about the area.
		The information provided on this website is based on first-hand 
		experience of the Chiclayo area. Since information can change pretty quickly, 
		students and professors from the Hotel Management, Tourism, Ecotourism, and 
		Gastronomy Major at UMB  will be updating and adding information when necessary.</string>
