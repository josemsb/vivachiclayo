      <div style="text-align:justify; margin:1em;" class="textContenido">
           <p>
          <strong>Before Your Trip:</strong> 
           <p>Many bus stations, grocery stores, and banks have trustworthy ATMs that you can use throughout your trip. Before you leave, be sure to tell your bank that you are leaving the country so they do not flag your debit or credit card as stolen. You will also need to make sure that you know your pin number, as it is different internationally for some institutions.
           <p>           
        <p><strong>Nuevo Soles:</strong>
        <p>Peru uses the Nuevo Sol for their monetary system. The Sol is divided into centimos of 5,10,20, and 50 in coins. Soles come in coins of 1, 2, or 5, and bills of 10,20,50,100, and 200. Always try and have small bills and coins on you, as many places do not carry much change. Many businesses also accept credit cards, though they may ask for your passport number first. Depending on your card provider, you may be charged a small fee for the international transaction. 
        <p>        
        <p><strong>Withdrawing Money: </strong></p>
        <p>
          Be cautious when using an ATM, and don't let people see how much you are drawing out, your pin number, or where you are putting your money after you withdraw it. Be smart–avoid drawing out money when it's dark or there are few people around. If something does not feel right about the ATM you are using, don't use it! It may be smart to keep your large bills one place, and your small bills and/or coins somewhere else, in case you are robbed or pick-pocketed. When taking out money, most ATMs will allow you to withdraw either Soles or American Dollars.

     <p dir="ltr">***Most ATMs will charge fees of around 14 soles per transaction. However, if you have a bank that is part of the international banking alliance, you may withdraw money for free when using a Scotiabank ATM.  The banks included in this alliance are as follows: ABSA, Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, China Construction Bank, Deutsche Bank, Santander Serfin, Scotiabank, Westpac, and UkrSibbank. Currently, the only bank in Peru part of this alliance is Scotiabank. Thus, if you have an account opened in one of these other banks, you should be able to withdraw money for free at Scotiabank ATMs.</p>
