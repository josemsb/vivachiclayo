        As in most Latin American cities, most <strong>everything revolves around the center area</strong>. Though it is called the “Plaza de Armas” in most cities, it is most commonly referred to here as the “Centro” or “Parque Principal”. There is a fountain and <strong>beautiful greenery in the park</strong>, and there are always people relaxing on the many benches around the square. The square is surrounded by everything from the <strong>Santa Maria Cathedral to shopping, restaurants, and bars</strong>. Just down the street from this is the <strong>“Paseo de las Musas”</strong>, a long park marked by sculptures and columns. If you aren’t quite sure what to do at night, take a walk down to the Centro and you will be sure to <strong>find something fun to do</strong>!

       <p><strong>Things to See:</strong></p>
       <p>- <strong>Paseo de las Musas</strong>: From the Centro, walk or drive along Av. Balta until you see the beginning of the Paseo de las Musas: a Pantheon-looking structure that says “Heroica Ciudad de Chiclayo”. From here, the park goes to the right and is marked by beautiful landscaping and sculptures and ends with a small children’s playground. This area is very popular, and you will often find the locals here taking wedding or quinceañera pictures!</p>

            <p><strong>- Santa Maria Cathedral</strong>: Built in 1869, this beautiful cathedral is an icon of the city of Chiclayo. Take time to go in, admire the beautiful artwork, and even watch or take part in the Mass.</p>

            <p>- <strong>Parades and Protests</strong>:  Occasionally, parades and protests take place in Chiclayo, most of them starting or ending in the Centro. Most protests are peaceful, but you will need to take caution if you happen to be there at a time when one is going on. Though somewhat rare, they can be an interesting cultural experience when they happen.</p>

            <p>- Some other fun things to do around the Centro include shopping, cafes, restaurants, karaoke, bars, and even just people-watching! </p>
