 In 2008, local workers decided to excavate the Cerro Pátapo ruins, and helped to uncover remains of the Wari culture. The Wari people were part of an empire spanning from south-central Peru to the Pátapo area sometime between the 7th and 12th centuries. The ruins uncovered in Pátapo consist of a series of rock walls remaining from buildings, such as a prisoner’s court and the residence of a Lord.
Though not an official tourist location, you can walk around and explore these ruins at your convenience. Another must-see location in this area is called the “Laguna del Inca”. Although it takes about a 1-hour drive and a 2-hour hike to reach this location, it is well worth it. This 32-foot deep body of crystal-clear water makes for great swimming and cliff-jumping on a warm day.
Although Pátapo is a small, often overlooked town, it has many historic offerings that are off the beaten track of the normal tourist circuit, and thus may add a bit of adventure to your time in Peru!
