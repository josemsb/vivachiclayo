      The Bosque de Pómac is an equatorial dry forest that is one of only four locations in Peru classified as a historical sanctuary. It houses many different types of fauna and flora, though its main attraction is the Sicán ruins that are inside the sanctuary. The Sicán, also called the Lambayeque, were a group of people that inhabited the northern coast of Peru from about 750-1375 AD. The Bosque de Pómac houses 36 pyramids (called “huacas”)  where archaeologists have discovered some of the finest Pre-Columbian pieces to date. These findings represent approximately 90% of all gold pieces found from the Lambayeque civilization. There are Lambayeque source populations that still call the Bosque de Pómac home, many of which are present near the site selling artisan crafts and cooking traditional meals. This site has been called an “unforgettable mix of nature and history”, as if you were brought back in time as a member of the Sicán culture. You will not want to pass up the opportunity to climb atop an ancient pyramid and see the dozens of ancient "huacas" rising up above the trees in this 23-square-mile forest. Be sure to bring bug spray to this area, the flies bite!
