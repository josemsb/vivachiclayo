        <p>This artisan market-the official name being “Parque Artesanal Atin”- is in the <strong>sleepy town of Eten</strong> and could easily be passed up if you did not know what you were looking for. As you walk inside, you find a courtyard surrounded by various shops. Each artisan has their own little shop, where they <strong>sell the handmade items</strong> they have personally created.</p>
        <p>Right when you walk in, there is a large room to the left where they do most of their weaving. Here, the women are <strong>excited to show you their work</strong>, and may even <strong>let you have a try at weaving</strong> if you would like! Visiting this market is fun, and is a breath of fresh air compared to other tourist-oriented shops. You have the <strong>chance to see the whole weaving process</strong>, buy some souvenirs, and <strong>converse with the actual people</strong> whose life work is to make these items!</p>
