       <strong>How to Stay Safe Around Chiclayo</strong> </div>
      <div style="text-align:justify; margin:1em;" class="textContenido">
        <p><strong>General Safety: </strong></p>
        <p>As is the case with visiting any foreign country, you will need to take extra safety precautions during your visit. Most people in Chiclayo and the rest of Peru are very kind and helpful. However, you should always be cautious of who you trust and how you protect your items. Pickpockets are common in Peru, and will often take the opportunity to steal from pockets or bags when you are not looking or are distracted. Keep valuables near you or lock them up when traveling. Leave money or valuables you will not be using in a safe place when you are out touring.
          A common strategy of thieves is to work as a team to distract you, whether by creating a fight in front of you, spilling something on you, bumping into you, or another distraction. In addition, watch bags, as occasionally bag slashers will use a razor blade to get to your items. Stay aware and look confident wherever you are going and you will be more likely to be safe. Avoid going anywhere late at night, and take a taxi recommended by your hotel or hostel to get anywhere after dark. </p>

         <p><strong>Food and Drinking Safety:</strong>           </p>
         <p>The tap water in Peru is not drinkableâ€“ only drink bottled or boiled water. Avoid fruits where you eat the peel, and wash all fruits and vegetables with clean water before eating. In addition, avoid foods that would use tap water in them that are not cooked, such as jello. Only eat at establishments where you trust the food is being cooked properly and has not been left out. Meat is something you will want to be especially careful about, as that is the type of food that causes the most difficulty with tourists. </p>

       	  <p><strong> Emergency Numbers:</strong></p>
        	<p> 
        	  In an emergency, the number to dial is 105 (used like the United States 911). For Travelers' Assistance (Not for Emergencies), Peru has set up a number that is open 24 hours a day to help those with questions. Dial  (01)(421)-1227 to reach this line.
