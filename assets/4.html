After being excavated by the archaeologist Ignacio Alva Meses in 2007, this ancient ceremonial site in Ventarrón has been opened to the public so that visitors can see one of America’s most ancient archaeological finds. The construction and design of the uncovered ruins are impressive, but the most unique and prized components of the site are the murals on the temple walls left behind by these ancient cultures.
According to carbon dating, Ventarrón’s temple and murals date back to  2000 BC, which means this site dates as far back as Hammurabi in Babylon, Abraham in the Bible, and the Xia Dynasty in China; the murals are believed to be the oldest discovered in the Americas. By exploring this ceremonial site, you will discover one of America’s oldest pre-ceramic cultures. Come and see what they have left behind!

A small museum features rocks and animal skeletons from around the area, and a garden shows some of the indigenous plants of Ventarrón. Kids especially will enjoy these sections, and might enjoy visiting this area halfway through visiting the archaeological area to take a quick break from listening. Eventually, a larger museum will be built that will exhibit the treasures found in Ventarrón.</td>
