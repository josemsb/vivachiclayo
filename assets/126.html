        <li><strong>Cancha:</strong>known as the Peruvian version of "Corn Nuts", this common snack is made from a type of corn called "maiz chulpe". When the kernels are heated, the inside does not burst out like popcorn, but the kernel becomes puffy and toasted, leaving it with a crunchy, starchy taste. Served lightly-salted, cancha is frequently served before meals or alongside ceviche, and can be quite the addicting snack!

Causa Rellena con Pollo is one of these hybrid dishes! It is a popular summer dish that layers mashed potatoes flavored with lime juice and aji pepper, with chicken salad. These layers are typically in the form of a rectangle, with olives, cilantro, and slices of hard-boiled eggs placed on top. This typical dish is served cold, and is an interesting yet delicious mix of flavors found in the region.</td>

It involves chunks of raw fish "cooked" with acid citrus juices (like lemon and lime), served with onions, and often spiced with aji or chili peppers. There are many different types of ceviche, with the most popular being shrimp, octopus, sea bass, and mixed (containing a variety). As the acidic juice does not cook the fish as well as heat does, it is important to eat at trustworthy locations to ensure that the fish is fresh. Dating back to the Incan time period, ceviche is a food that has been around for a long time, and is boasted about by the local people!  </td>
