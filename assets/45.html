 The Chaparri Reserve is located in the dry forest of Lambayeque and is home to many rare animals, including the Andean/spectacled bear, white-winged guan, guanaco, and Andean condor as well as 196 other recorded species of birds! The Chaparri forest requires a guide to enter, and calling ahead is recommended since it is limited to just 30 visitors per day.
This park features 3 visitor trails, as well as a vulture feeding station. Other animals include iguanas, pumas, and deer. Be sure to visit this reserve for the opportunity to see unique animals in an exclusive environment shared with just a few other tourists!
