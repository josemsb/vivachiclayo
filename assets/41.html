      <div style="text-align:justify; margin:1em;" class="textContenido">      
         Pimentel is one of the most well-known and popular beaches in the Lambayeque region. There is a long dock that extends into the ocean on which you can take a stroll out to the very end. This dock has a board pathway down the center, making the walk a little safer than most docks in the area. The shores of this beach are lined by small restaurants, shops, and apartments, and on the beach there are old, colorful boats that the local fishermen occasionally take out. You can check out the traditional reed boats of Lambayeque, called caballitos de totora, and see the  fishermen at work in them. Come enjoy a quiet, relaxing beach with beautiful sunsets and friendly people, while still holding true to the exciting Peruvian culture!
