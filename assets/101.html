        <p><strong>Flight Info: </strong></p>
        <p>The Capitán FAP José A. Quiñones González International Airport, is on the outskirts of Chiclayo, with flights going and coming daily to and from Lima. There are also flights to and from the cities of Piura, Trujillo, and Cajamarca. The best airlines to use within the country are usually LAN and StarPeru. When you walk outside of the airport, there are usually dozens of taxi drivers waiting, so it won’t be difficult to find one, negotiate a price, and go to your hotel. Be sure to take a taxi with a lighted sign on top of it to ensure that a safe and reliable company is driving you. </p>
