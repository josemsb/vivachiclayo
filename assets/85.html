      <div style="text-align:justify; margin:1em;" class="textContenido">
If you are in Peru for an extended amount of time, you might consider buying a phone to keep in contact with friends, family, and/or businesses either inside or outside of the country. For someone who is not used to the phone system, it can be a bit confusing at first. Below is a guide of how to dial numbers, should the need arise during your visit.

        	<td style="background-color:#FFF">Some countries require an "exit code" when calling a cell phone internationally, so you will need to check this before calling (the US is 011).  Dial the exit code, if required, then 51, and the 9-digit number. Ex: 011-51-987-654-321</td>           
        </tr> 
          <tr><td>Calling Internationally from Peru</td></tr>
    	<tr>
        	<td style="background-color:#FFF">This is a bit more complicated, as it depends what country you are calling, what phone provider you have, what plan you have, etc. You may want to check into this before leaving. If you have a "smart phone", some good ways to keep in contact with friends or family during your trip without having to purchase an international plan is the application "Viber" (only requires Wifi and the other person to also have the app), MagicJack, Skype, etc. You can usually get free Wifi at Starbucks (located in the food court of Real Plaza in Chiclayo).</td>

    	<tr>
        	<td style="background-color:#FFF">If you are traveling for an extended period of time and will need to be communicating a lot, you may want to consider purchasing a cell phone. The two big phone providers in Peru are Claro and MoviStar. They have stores and kiosks all over the place, and you can easily pick up a "to go phone" of sorts. Adding minutes as you go, this is a good alternative to purchasing an international plan if most of your calls will be within Peru.</td>
