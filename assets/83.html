        <p>Information About Bathrooms and Time Differences:
          Bathrooms: Bathrooms are available in most public areas, and may require a small fee to use. Not all bathrooms will supply toilet paper, and if they do, often times the dispenser will be near the sinks at the front for patrons to obtain before going into the stall. In addition, many bathrooms will not supply or may be out of toilet paper and/or paper towels. </p>
        <p>Plan accordingly and carry around hand sanitizer and toilet paper at all times. </p>
        <p>Bathrooms are marked most often with the words SSHH (Servicios Higi√©nicos) or WC (Water Closet) and marked as damas (women) and caballeros/hombres (men).          </p>
