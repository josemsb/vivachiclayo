      <div style="text-align:justify; margin:1em;" class="textContenido">
A little off the beaten path, this beach town has a very quiet, peaceful feel to it. It is lesser known, and therefore receives fewer visitors. But don’t let this fool you– this hidden gem, with long, clean beaches and large waves, is the perfect escape! The town itself is sprinkled with flowers, beautiful murals, and friendly people. Close to the center of town, you can visit an old train yard and explore the beautiful train cars left there. Not cluttered by an excess of pollution, cars, or people, Eten is the perfect place to spend a day to relax. Close to the beach are the beautiful ruins of a church from the 1600’s that was partially destroyed by a tsunami hundreds of years ago. Eten is rumored to be the landing place of Naylamp, the founder of the Lambayeque civilization. Come combine history and nature by playing at the ruins, walking the beach, and spending time in the beautiful beach town of Eten!

The wood pieces used are further apart than normal, requiring you to carefully traverse this dock (we do not recommend this walk for those who are scared of heights or don’t have the steadiest feet). Those who choose to walk it will be rewarded with a stunning view of the beach and the cliffs nearby, and may even get a close view of surfers jumping off the pier to catch the bigger waves. The pier entrance fee is about 2 soles.</td>
