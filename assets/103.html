        <p><strong>Taxis & Moto-Taxis: </strong></p>
        <p>It usually costs 3-6 soles to get anywhere within Chiclayo, depending on the time of day and the taxi company. They may try to overcharge you as a tourist, so confirm with them the price before you get in the taxi. Almost anywhere you go in the city, it will be easy to find a taxi, as they are always driving around. There are also moto-taxis everywhere that you can take for less money. We recommend that you do this at least once–it’s a fun experience! </p>
