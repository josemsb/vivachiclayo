        <p>The Bosque de Pómac, widely known as the home of an array of pyramids from the ancient Sicán civilization, is also an <strong>ecological wonderland</strong> just 40 minutes from the heart of Chiclayo. It is <strong>one of only four historic reserves in Peru</strong>, making it a must-see destination. It is the <strong>world’s largest equatorial dry forest</strong>, and is made up of mostly algorrobo (carob) trees. From these trees, local people can produce a myriad of different things: honey and carob syrup, furniture, charcoal, dye, firewood, sweetener, and medicine.</p>
        <p>This forest is also the <strong>home to 70 bird species, 7 mammal species, and 9 reptile species</strong>. Being called an <strong>“unforgettable mix of nature and history”</strong>, it is an excellent place to go<strong>bird-watching, hike to the pyramids, ride horses, or just spend a day admiring the pyramids</strong> while relaxing under the trees!</p>

	    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	    <p><strong>2. The Millennial Tre</strong>e: Come see this impressive Algorrobo tree that is said to be nearly a millennium old, and has many miracles and legends attributed to it by the local people.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Cultural Demonstrations</strong>: Outside of the protected area of the forest, there are many places where you can learn to weave, do ceramic work, or try some typical food of the area. Tell your tour guide what you specifically want to do, and they will likely know the best place to go.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> There are still some Lambayeque source populations living nearby, many of which are present near the site selling artisan crafts and cooking traditional meals.</p>
        <p><strong>Tips:</strong> Be sure to bring sunblock and bug spray as well as close-toed shoes.</p>
